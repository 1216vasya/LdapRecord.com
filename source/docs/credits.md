# Credits

LdapRecord was based heavily on Laravel's fantastic ORM [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent)
which was created by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell). Many of it's features and
documentation are direct ports to be used for LDAP.

Without its battle tested infrastructure already built, this package would not have the stability and
usability that was granted from his thousands of hours of hard work, and of course the hundreds to
thousands of contributors that has brought continuous improvements to the Laravel framework.

If you can, please support [Taylor Otwell's](https://github.com/taylorotwell) work. It is my belief that
he has made web development with PHP a fun and exciting experience - without costing developers a dime.
