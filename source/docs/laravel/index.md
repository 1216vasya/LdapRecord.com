# Overview

LdapRecord-Laravel is a package that provides you the ability to
search your LDAP directory, perform operations, and authenticate
LDAP users into your Laravel application.

It uses the core LdapRecord package under the hood, so be sure to look at its
[documentation](/docs/) so you have an understanding of how everything works.
It was created with the mindset of porting Laravel's fantastic Eloquent
database ORM to an LDAP equivalent.

If you ever encounter issues or simply need some help getting up and running,
please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/issues/new)
and I would be happy to help you out.
